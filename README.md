SIMPLE TASK

This is a demo app created by Marco Castillo. It includes the following library created by him:

- routing for http nodejs
- mongo handler for mongodb client
- json-reader for front-end template

This project is not using any dependency, just mongodb.

- JavaScript is vanila
- CSS is vanila
- NodeJS Server is vanila using the HTTP module included in NodeJS

NOTE: This is not a production product or final product. But it has the minimum logic for this demo.

MONGO REQUIREMENT

I am using the free cluster provided by mongodb.com. The connection string must be changed in:

./task-table.js

My mongodb handler created the database, table if it does not exists. Just change the connection string and everything will work.
